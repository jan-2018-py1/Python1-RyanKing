pip install Django
	had some trouble here. apparently django v 1.12 isn't working with my setup of python 2.7 and ubuntu 16.04.
	was getting an error during installation:
		AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'lru_cache'
	after some googling, I found using version 1.11 (pip install Django==1.11) worked for me.

pip list
	response:
		adium-theme-ubuntu (0.3.4)
		Django (1.11)
		pip (9.0.1)
		pygobject (3.20.0)
		pytz (2017.3)
		pyudev (0.16.1)
		setuptools (20.7.0)
		unity-lens-photos (1.0)
		wheel (0.29.0)
	lists the packages installed/tracked by pip (by python?)

pip install Django (again)
	response:
		Requirement already satisfied: Django in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
		Requirement already satisfied: pytz in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (from Django)
	confirms that it's already installed

pip freeze
	response:
		adium-theme-ubuntu==0.3.4
		Django==1.11
		pygobject==3.20.0
		pytz==2017.3
		pyudev==0.16.1
		unity-lens-photos==1.0
	returns most of the packages shown by "pip list", but formatted a little differently?

pip uninstall Django
	starts to uninstall Django (cancelled at the y/n confirm prompt)

pip show Django
	shows the details of the currently installed version of Django

pip search Flask
	returns a list of all of the packages that contain the word "Flask"
